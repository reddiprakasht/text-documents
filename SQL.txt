The users cannot see the indexes, they are just to speed up searches/queries

CREATE INDEX idx_lastname

Show INDEX FROM table_name;

DROP index table.name_name; ==>sql

or
ALter Table table_name DROP INDEX index_name; ==> MySQL

CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'abcd1234';


Show users
Select user from MySQL.user;

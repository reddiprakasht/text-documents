GitHub:
=======================
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, primarily used for software development. It uses Git, a version control system, to help developers track changes in their code over time, collaborate on projects, and manage different versions of their software.

so we just remember it is a online storage platform and it is a medium for two or many local machines (our laptos) for exchange their code.

we first create a GitHub account.

and configure our git bash.



configuration our GitBash :

first we need to set our user.name and user.email  so then GitHub knows who's trying to push and pull the code.

for that :
----------------------------

git config --global user.name "nranjan"

git config --global user.email "abc@gmail.com



in VS Code :

some important Linux commands with GitHub. 

--------------------------------------------------

git clone our GitHub repository path

git status 

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

git remote set-url https://github.com/username/repo.git   (if we want to reset the existing path of the repository)

git remote -v    (check the remote repository path)



now write the code. create some files. 


now we have to save this to our git repository that we just created. 

it involves 3 steps:

git add .

( when we use git add . this is called stagging area it shows all changes that we have done in current repository )

git commit -m "our message for what we change in our code"

git push


git log

git log --oneline  (it is about commit ID)



((

git fetch

git pull

git branch 

git branch checkout

git merge

))


basic Linux commands 


cd   (going forward to folder)
cd .. (back to previous command)

dir (it will show what are the files that are present in the present folder)

mkdir (make directory that is a folder)

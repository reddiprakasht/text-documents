Core Java-----
===================

It is a part of the JAVA programming language that one can use for developing or creating a general purpose apps. Its main focus is to build such general applications. The J2SE (java standard edition) id known as Core Java. it mainly covers concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)

JDK, JRE and JVM:

1. JDK (Java Development kit) : The JDK is used by developers to write, compile, and debug java code.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): End users use the JRE to run JAva applications
3. JVM (JAva Virtual Machine): The JVM is the runtime engine that executes Java bytecode, and it is included in both the JDK and the JRE.


JDK ---in JDK we have 
			JRE in JRE (development tools eg.,javac, java, etc.,) in that JRE we have
												 JVM contains (set of libraries eg., rt.jar etc., and Otherfiles)

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

JVM (java virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Javaapplications. JVM is the one that actually calls the MAIN method present in a java code. JVM  is a part of JRE.

Java application are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expert it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.

When we Compile a .java file, class files (contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the java Compiler, This class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.

Java Class file:
---------------------------------------
A java class file is a file containing java bytecode that can be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). A Java class file is usually produces by a Java Compiler from Java Programming language source file (.java files) containing Java classes (alternatively, other JVM language can also be used to create class files) If a source file has more than one class, each class is compiled into a separate file


in java file name and class name should be the same (rule-1)

When the above law is violated a compiler error message will appear.

HOw to check java VErsion -?
	java -version

===============
Escape sequence are used to signal an alternative interpretation of a series of charecters. in java, a character preceded by a backslash(\) is an escape sequence.

\\	insert a backslash
\n 	insert a newline
\"	insert a double quote
\'	insert a single quote
\t 	insert a tab
\b	insert a backspace=> System.out.println("hello\bjava");
\r	insert a carriage return in the text at this point
"i like this \r No start over" --> prints only No start over 


Eclipse:
===================
Eclipse is the most popular IDE for java application development in order to use Eclipse effectively, we must familiar with the workbench, concepts and components of eclipse IDE.

what is workspace in eclipse?
1. A workspace is a location on your machine where all the work you do through Eclipse will be stored as files.
2. when we run Eclipse, the launcher will pop up and ask us to select a directory for our workspace.
3. A workspace in eclipse is a directory to store all out=r separate projects.
